Hey there :) I am an Android Developer currently working at [KeepTruckin](https://keeptruckin.com/ "KeepTruckin"). Prior to this, I lead the team building the [Tickertape](https://www.tickertape.in) Android app. I am also an Open Source enthusiast and an active contributor. One of the biggest projects I worked on is [Firefox Focus](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/commits?author=SubhrajyotiSen). For more details on my career, you can take a look at my [resume](subhrajyoti.me/resume.pdf).

I used to conduct research on recognizing handwritten Kannada documents. You can find one of the papers on [IEEEXplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9012531 "IEEE Xplore").

When not writing code, you can find me reading books of literally any genre, trying to better understand public policy or just watching (and even sketching) some good old anime. You can find some of my artwork on [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/subhrajyotisen/gallery/ "DeviantArt Subhrajyoti Sen"). In the recent past, I used to tinker with custom ROMs and provided support for multiple popular devices. This lead to me becoming a [Recognised Developer at XDA Developers](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=6623671).

I also mentor people trying to break into tech or just getting started with Android development. You can setup a chat with me on my [Calendly](https://calendly.com/subhrajyotisen "Subhrajyoti's Calendly").
