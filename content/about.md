Hi! I am an Android Developer. Currently, I am building the app behind [Tickertape](https://www.tickertape.in). I am also an Open Source enthusiast and an active contributor.

In my free time, I tinker around with custom ROMs. I am fortunate enough to be a [Recognised Developer at XDA Developers](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=6623671). When I am not working on side projects, you can find me making [anime sketches](https://www.deviantart.com/subhrajyotisen/gallery/) or binge-watching TV shows.
