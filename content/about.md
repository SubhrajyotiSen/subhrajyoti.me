Hey there :) I am a Software Engineer specializing in mobile technologies, currently working on developer tooling at [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/). Previously, I led mobile teams at [Motive](https://gomotive.com/en-gb/) and [Tickertape](https://www.tickertape.in). As an open source enthusiast and active contributor, I have worked on significant projects including [Firefox Focus](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/commits?author=SubhrajyotiSen). For a comprehensive overview of my professional experience, please refer to my [resume](https://subhrajyoti.me/resume.pdf).

My research background includes work on handwritten Kannada document recognition, with published findings available on [IEEEXplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9012531).

Beyond software development, my interests span diverse areas including literature, public policy analysis, and anime appreciation and illustration. I have also contributed to the Android community through custom ROM development, earning recognition as a [Recognised Developer at XDA Developers](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=6623671).

I am passionate about mentoring individuals at different stages of their technical career. To schedule a conversation, please visit my [Cal.com](https://cal.com/subhrajyoti "Subhrajyoti's Cal.com") calendar.
