      <description>Hey there :) I am an Android Developer currently working at KeepTruckin. Prior to this, I lead the team building the Tickertape Android app. I am also an Open Source enthusiast and an active contributor. One of the biggest projects I worked on is Firefox Focus. For more details on my career, you can take a look at my resume.
I used to conduct research on recognizing handwritten Kannada documents. You can find one of the papers on IEEEXplore.</description>
