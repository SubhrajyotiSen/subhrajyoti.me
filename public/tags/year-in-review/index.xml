      <description>I have never really done a year in review before. The reason being that I never had a year that I thought was worth a review. But this year was quite different. The first year I am truly proud of.
Favouritest thing of the year (Yes, that was an intentional typo :P)
The best about the year was my GitHub contributions graph. I went from 0 contributions in 2015 to 609 in 2016.</description>
