      <description>Before starting out the procedure, I would hihgly recommend building it on a high-spec VPS and not on your personal computer. You could try out the free-trial of Google Cloud Platform. The guide will assume you are on a Linux system. Please don&amp;rsquo;t try building on any other OS
Installing required tools and libraries For this I recommend using the scripts from Akhil Narang&amp;rsquo;s script repo. I personally use a Ubuntu on a build server.</description>

      <description>So I came across thisquestion on StackOverflow asking how one can share an image on WhatsApp along with a caption. Before the question could be answered, two users incorrectly marked it as a duplicate.
So I thought of sharing my answer here so that it can help out others.
We start by creating an ACTION_SEND Intent since the Intent sends data
Intent intent = new Intent(); intent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_SEND); We set the Intent type to image since we are primarily sending an image</description>
