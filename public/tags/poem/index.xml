      <description>A stranger needn&amp;rsquo;t be someone you&amp;rsquo;ve never met.
It can be someone you know really well.
It can be someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t mind being in pjs in front of you.
It can be someone who planned a trip to Spain with you.
It can be someone who wanted to explore all the food streets with you.
Mom was right. Sometimes.
We should be careful of strangers.
Coz some promises are never kept.</description>
