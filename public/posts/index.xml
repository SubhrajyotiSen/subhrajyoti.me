            <description>Before starting out the procedure, I would hihgly recommend building it on a high-spec VPS and not on your personal computer. You could try out the free-trial of Google Cloud Platform. The guide will assume you are on a Linux system. Please don&amp;rsquo;t try building on any other OS
Installing required tools and libraries For this I recommend using the scripts from Akhil Narang&amp;rsquo;s script repo. I personally use a Ubuntu on a build server.</description>

The guide will assume you are on a Linux system. Please don&rsquo;t try building on any other OS</p>
<h2 id="installing-required-tools-and-libraries">Installing required tools and libraries</h2>
<p>For this I recommend using the scripts from Akhil Narang&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/akhilnarang/scripts">script</a> repo.
I personally use a Ubuntu on a build server. So I will execute <a href="https://github.com/akhilnarang/scripts/blob/master/setup/android_build_env.sh">android_build_env.sh</a> script.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sh setup/android_build_env.sh
</code></pre></div><h2 id="syncing-the-sources">Syncing the sources</h2>
<p>You can find the syncing instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/android">LineageOS android repo</a>.</p>
<p>For this you will need to install <code>repo</code>. Run the following commands in your home directory</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mkdir ~/bin
PATH<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>~/bin:$PATH
curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo &gt; ~/bin/repo
chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
</code></pre></div><p>Now that you have <code>repo</code>, run the following commands to start syncing the project. Make sure you have enough free space since the download can be ~50GB</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mkdir los

</code></pre></div><p>Now you need to add your local manifest</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mkdir .repo/local_manifests

</code></pre></div><p>Now start syncing the sources</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">repo sync -cfj8 --current-branch --no-tags --no-clone-bundle --optimized-fetch --prune
</code></pre></div><p>Now kindly go to something productive as this might take a while depending on connection speed.</p>
<p>Once it is done, it&rsquo;s time to start building.</p>
<p>It is always a good idea to setup ccache as this will make the future builds faster</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">export USE_CCACHE<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Here I am using 50GB ccache. You can specify the size depending on how much space you have available</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">. build/envsetup.sh
lunch lineage_whyred-userdeug
make bacon -j8
</code></pre></div><p>This will start the build. It can take a few hours depending on the specs of your machine.</p>
<p>If all goes well, you will get a success message and your build should be available in los/out/target/product/whyred/</p>
<p>If you get errors along the way, in most cases a direct Google search should help fix yours error.</p>
<h2 id="signing-your-build">Signing your build</h2>
<p>The LineageOS Wiki has detailed steps to <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/signing_builds.html">Sign your build</a>. So no point in repeating them here.</p>
<h2 id="building-lineage-recovery">Building Lineage Recovery</h2>
<p>If you insist on building and using Lineage recovery, here are the steps</p>

            <title>Adding support YouTube unofficial clients to Dank</title>
            <link>https://subhrajyoti.me/posts/adding-support-youtube-unofficial-clients-to-dank/</link>

            <guid>https://subhrajyoti.me/posts/adding-support-youtube-unofficial-clients-to-dank/</guid>
            <description>Dank is the most Reddit client there is. If you aren’t aware of its awesome-ness yet, go [read about it](https://saket.me/dank/) right now. And the best part is that it’s Open Source, which is also the reason this post exists.
When the user clicks on any URL, one of the things Dank does is to determine if the URL is a YouTube URL. If it is one, Dank tries to open it in the YouTube app if it is installed.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dank is the most Reddit client there is. If you aren’t aware of its awesome-ness yet, go [read about it](<a href="https://saket.me/dank/" title="https://saket.me/dank/">https://saket.me/dank/</a>) right now. And the best part is that it’s Open Source, which is also the reason this post exists.</p>
<p>When the user clicks on any URL, one of the things Dank does is to determine if the URL is a YouTube URL. If it is one, Dank tries to open it in the YouTube app if it is installed. If the YouTube is not present on the user’s device, it opens it as a regular link.</p>
<p>Here comes the issue. Checking just the presence of the installed app is not sufficient. Here is why:</p>
<p>On non-rooted Android devices, the user does not get an option to uninstall system apps. YouTube comes as a system app on most devices. But the user does get an option to disable it.</p>
<p>If an app is disabled, the package is still installed but is unavailable for any functionality. Any Intent that tries to use this package will fail.</p>
<p>In my case, I had disabled the YouTube app (more on that later). So when I clicked on any YouTube link in Dank, Dank noticed that I have the YouTube app installed and tried to open in the Link using it. But this failed with a Toast message.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s275/res/e070cfb7-dbf1-401b-979e-70cdb3c8ae7a" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s dig into some code</p>
<p>A quick search for the string “youtube” in the codebase lead me to the `findAllowedPackageNameForDeepLink` in the[UrlRouter](<a href="https://github.com/saket/Dank/blob/39beb5bdd01bb7e1203847be4b2dde5c2fb192fc/app/src/main/java/me/saket/dank/ui/UrlRouter.java#L220" title="https://github.com/saket/Dank/blob/39beb5bdd01bb7e1203847be4b2dde5c2fb192fc/app/src/main/java/me/saket/dank/ui/UrlRouter.java#L220">https://github.com/saket/Dank/blob/39beb5bdd01bb7e1203847be4b2dde5c2fb192fc/app/src/main/java/me/saket/dank/ui/UrlRouter.java#L220</a>) class.</p>
<p>This method is invoked from the `intent` function [here](<a href="https://github.com/saket/Dank/blob/39beb5bdd01bb7e1203847be4b2dde5c2fb192fc/app/src/main/java/me/saket/dank/ui/UrlRouter.java#L102" title="https://github.com/saket/Dank/blob/39beb5bdd01bb7e1203847be4b2dde5c2fb192fc/app/src/main/java/me/saket/dank/ui/UrlRouter.java#L102">https://github.com/saket/Dank/blob/39beb5bdd01bb7e1203847be4b2dde5c2fb192fc/app/src/main/java/me/saket/dank/ui/UrlRouter.java#L102</a>).</p>
<p>Right after calling `findAllowedPackageNameForDeepLink`, there is an invocation to a function `isPackageNameInstalled `.</p>
<p>The `isPackageNameInstalled` function is where the issue happens. It just checks if the package is installed. Our problem can be fixed by modifying the function to the following.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s275/res/8a1b00f7-0137-41d4-a5c8-fc095113162d" alt=""></p>
<p>I have also renamed the function to give more context to the functionality.</p>
<p>Now if the YouTube is not present or is disabled, Dank opens it as a regular URL and I am able to watch the video. First step done.</p>
<p>Remember I mentioned that I have the YouTube app disabled? That’s because I use a YouTube MOD called YouTube vanced (because YouTube</p>
<p>took ages to provide a dark theme) and also a YouTube downloader app installed. Now let’s add support to open YouTube links in third-party clients/MODs.</p>
<p>A YouTube video can be opened using the following Intent.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s275/res/2cfd04b0-0dd7-4711-bd9f-36a119eb8066" alt=""></p>
<p>Once we have a YouTube URL, we can use Regular Expressions to extract</p>
<p>the video ID</p>

            <description>A stranger needn&amp;rsquo;t be someone you&amp;rsquo;ve never met.
It can be someone you know really well.
It can be someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t mind being in pjs in front of you.
It can be someone who planned a trip to Spain with you.
It can be someone who wanted to explore all the food streets with you.
Mom was right. Sometimes.
We should be careful of strangers.
Coz some promises are never kept.</description>

            <guid>https://subhrajyoti.me/posts/share-image-along-with-caption-on-whatsapp/</guid>
            <description>So I came across thisquestion on StackOverflow asking how one can share an image on WhatsApp along with a caption. Before the question could be answered, two users incorrectly marked it as a duplicate.
So I thought of sharing my answer here so that it can help out others.
We start by creating an ACTION_SEND Intent since the Intent sends data
Intent intent = new Intent(); intent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_SEND); We set the Intent type to image since we are primarily sending an image</description>

            <description>I have never really done a year in review before. The reason being that I never had a year that I thought was worth a review. But this year was quite different. The first year I am truly proud of.
Favouritest thing of the year (Yes, that was an intentional typo :P)
The best about the year was my GitHub contributions graph. I went from 0 contributions in 2015 to 609 in 2016.</description>

<h4 id="favouritest-thing-of-the-year">Favouritest thing of the year</h4>
<p>(Yes, that was an intentional typo :P)</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2016_graph.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The best about the year was my GitHub contributions graph. I went from 0 contributions in 2015 to 609 in 2016. I also contributed to multiple Open Source projects throughout the year (HacktoberFest being a special bonus).<br>
I was also able to publish my first Android Library <a href="https://github.com/SubhrajyotiSen/PasswordView">PasswordView</a> which seemed to have gotten a decent response.</p>
<h4 id="android-developer-nanodegree">Android Developer Nanodegree</h4>
<p>In march, I received a scholarship to pursue the Android Developer Nanodegree at Udacity. It has been an amazing learning experience till now. I never really thought I would be making widgets and watchfaces for my app anytime soon. But the Nanodegree changed that. Two months till graduation (Yaay :D)</p>
<h4 id="mozilla">Mozilla</h4>
<p>After a lot of delay, I was finally able to start my contributions to Mozilla. I started out with One and Done tests and now I&rsquo;m actively taking part in Firefox Test days.<br>
Next up was localizing articles in Bengali (which helped me improve my rusty Bengali too xD ).<br>
Another amazing thing which I was able to do was <a href="https://subhrajyotisen.wordpress.com/2016/07/29/maker-part-16-day-1/">teaching kids about the Web</a>.</p>
<h4 id="heliox-and-roms">Heliox and ROMs</h4>
<p>After trying for a really long time, I was finally able to build my own Android kernel called Heliox and compile tons of custom ROMs for my phone. One hell of an experience. A big shout out to Sarthak Narang, Nachiket Namjoshi and Rohit Poroli for being the best guides in my journey.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping to another amazing year. Until next time..</p>

            <description>We, the members of Avant- Garde Mozilla Club, host a Maker Party recently in Bangalore with kids from 5th and 6th grade
The party was planned in two sessions
 Day 1: Basics of Computer Networking and terminology Day 2: Basics of HTML. Build a website that the kids draw on paper. Remix a new website using X-Ray Goggles.  Here is the planning doc for the event
Since kids of all ages (even grown ups) play video games, we figured that it would be an ideal topic for an ice-breaker session.</description>

<p>Since kids of all ages (even grown ups) play video games, we figured that it would be an ideal topic for an ice-breaker session. So we asked the kids to interact with each other and find out who plays the same games as them. The person to tell the most name wins a swag. This really raised the energy in the room.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/27581629483_2a0348344e_z.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Next up, Srushtika asked a really important and interesting question, “What is the Internet?”. We received a wide variety of replies, each correct in their own way. Later, she combined all the answers together and gave them a proper simplified definition.</p>
<p>After everyone understood what the Internet is, she started explaining the concepts of ‘Sender’, ‘Receiver’ and ‘Server’. She used the example of a person trying to send a copy of a big game to his friend who lives in a different country. A carton box was compared to a server providing the space to store the game. They understood the concept pretty well.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/28196997395_62d1a6c067_z.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Next, it was the storytelling session by me. I told them a story involving the characters from the famous cartoon series “Doraemon” ! It involved one of the characters (Nobita) wanting to send a message to another character (Suzuka). But, a negative character (Jian) was to stop the message from being sent and tried to see whats inside the message. We asked the kids to volunteer to enact this particular scene. They had fun and had a little chase sequence too 😉 Using this we explained the terms, “Security” and “Encryption”. They very much understood them very accurately.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/blogy.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The next activity was the most liked by the kids. (End with a bang, strategy ? 😉 ) We explained the concept of packets in a network with a very interactive hands on activity. Veeresh started off by explaining them a little about it and he showed them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7CuFlM4V54">this</a> video. Further, we made a path using a marker on the tiles floor of the hall, including a number of hops, leading to various servers (kept as carton boxes). Here’s a picture:</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/blogx1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The kids were a very lively bunch ready to grasp whatever comes their way. Veeresh continued with a brief discussion on IP addresses with reference to the contact numbers and the names saved against each number in the phone-book of the mobiles. It was an easy catch.</p>
<p>We then, gave them an assignment for the next session. After explain the correlation of a webpage with the web, we asked them to draw a plain drawing of their dream website and promised them to develop the best among those in the subsequent session!</p>

            <description>So a few members of our club started brainstorming on ideas for the next event by MVIT Mozillans. We had already discussed many possibilities such workshops on Java, Python etc when one of us suggested a hands-on session with git. Since git is at the heart of Open Source and is a tool that every programmer should be aware of and use, the idea instantly clicked with the entire team. And so it was decided.</description>

<p><img src="/uploads/12779107_466723330182336_5437344378809871337_o.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The session was on the 5th of March. The guest speakers for the day were Kaustav Das Modak and Jaipradeesh Janarthanan. We had around 80 participants (that’s a good number considering that IISc had their Open Day on the same date).</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/25524129455_fc26115199_h.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The event started off with the club members making sure that all technical details were taken of. The speakers took turns while explaining the basics of Git. The analogies given for Git were quite interesting.</p>
<p>As members of the club, it was useful for us too since we all want to contribute to Open Source but not knowing how to use Git was a major hurdle. I’m sure that after this event, each one us can easily start using Git for our projects and soon even start contributing to OS projects too since that’s the reason the club was started for.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/25408896962_447c468e95_z.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The feedback from the participants was amazing. Everyone just loved the speakers and by the end of the day had learnt something new. All in all, the event was a huge success and a great learning experience. Until next time…</p>

<p>Writing code is hard. For every 1 minute of bliss typing characters in the computer and seeing it render things that didn’t exist before, there are 10 minutes of frustration with unreadable code and bugs that didn’t exist the night before.</p>
<p>Writing code with Git is hard. Writing code without it is <em>unthinkable</em>. Whether you’re senior developer on a huge team or a designer who just started dabbling with front-end for personal projects, using Git will change the way you code for the best and make group collaboration enjoyable.</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through basic concepts in Git with some hands-on action at the end. It won’t make you a Git master, but you will be able to use Git by yourself with <a href="https://www.github.com/">Github</a> and its <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">desktop app</a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<h4 id="what-is-git"><strong>What is Git</strong></h4>
<p>Git is a distributed version-control system for code.</p>
<p>Descriptive but not very helpful, right? Let me tell you a true story then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re working on a small website. You’ve been trying to get that sticky footer right for a whole hour and somehow only managed to make it worse in the process. It’s 2AM. You hate CSS and is currently in the process of re-thinking your life choices. Screw this, <strong>let’s go back to the previous version from 3 hours ago</strong> and watch some Netflix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Oh wait.</strong></p>
<p>The <em>previous version</em>. You don’t have it anymore, do you?</p>
<p>What if every change in your project was tracked — every character and line of code you added or deleted. What if you could save <em>all</em> of your code at <em>every</em> stage of your work?</p>
<p>That way, once you started working on the <em>feature/sticky-footer</em>, you were sure nothing would be lost if you decided to roll back — and you could even go back to work on this feature later if you wanted to.</p>
<h4 id="git-is-a-time-machine-for-code"><strong>Git is a time machine for code</strong></h4>
<p>That’s what Git does. It tracks and saves <strong>snapshots of your entire codebase</strong> and allows you to easily distribute it to other developers (either teammates or people on the internet). In practice, Git will allow you to:</p>
<p>Roll-back changes in your code<br>
Develop new features without affecting code that’s already live<br>
Collaborate with other developers <em>in the same code</em> <em>at the same time without going insane</em><br>
Make it <em>really hard</em> to screw things up</p>

            <title>Mozilla Advocacy Workshop</title>
            <link>https://subhrajyoti.me/posts/mozilla-advocacy-workshop/</link>

            <description>It all started with the vision of keeping the Web Open. But as with any other such awesome thing, the Web too comes under threat from time to time. Such a threat was the issue of ‘Tiered Network Access‘ in India. What this threat made me realize is the importance of advocacy and spreading awareness but an Open Web. So when I heard that there was going to be a workshop on the same, I just had to attend it.</description>

Such a threat was the issue of ‘<strong>Tiered Network Access</strong>‘ in India. What this threat made me realize is the importance of advocacy and spreading awareness but an Open Web. So when I heard that there was going to be a workshop on the same, I just had to attend it. Plus it was at the Mozilla Community Space in Bangalore (could it get any cooler?)</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/24541356813_ed77e52792_z.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The event was kicked off with Anivar giving us a brief of what Advocacy task force has been upto since last year and how it contributed to the victory of Net Neutrality in India. We were joined by Sara Hagdoosti and Jochai Ben-Avi from Mozilla who briefed us about what Mozilla had planned for India and how Mozilla itself contributed to Net Neutrality victory.</p>
<p>Later on, Abhiram joined in and gave us a nice presentation on what happened at the Leadership Summit, Singapore and also shared his experience and what he learnt there. As a part of his presentation, he mentioned the tracks which we could use to approach Advocacy properly. We were then divided into 3 teams and each team had to brainstorm on how we can go about the tracks mentioned. By the end of the session, we had almost a wall full of sticky notes. I don’t think any of us ever thought we could come up with so many ideas or rather approaches so fast.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/25075159561_3f76781770_z.jpg" alt=""><img src="/uploads/25168418155_5c5c272951_o.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/uploads/brain.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And then came the food…. well I won’t say much about it. But just that it was awesome. It was nice time to talk to new people and network too. Learnt a lot about different people got involved with Mozilla and the open source movement.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/cake.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After lunch, Srushtika spoke on how the ideas that we discussed can be implemented in our college campus and what issues we might face. Sara and Jochai were really supportive and brought up some interesting queries. They were really welcome to suggestions and criticism.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/srush.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>At the end of the day, it was really an amazing and informative experience. Got a chance to meet some awesome Mozillians and catch up with a few past acquaintances. And we got T-shirts too.</p>
<p>Until next time…</p>

            <description>So it had been some time since I had become a FSA and was really looking forward toward an activity outside my college. As luck would have it, Firefox Developer Edition was one of the sponsors for inGenius 2015 organized by PESIT (South Campus), Bangalore.
A few members from our club had been invited to the hackathon as mentors. Now the word ‘mentor’ itself makes it all the more interesting. I was invited to mentor teams on Android as well as open source technologies.</description>

<p>A few members from our club had been invited to the hackathon as mentors. Now the word ‘mentor’ itself makes it all the more interesting. I was invited to mentor teams on Android as well as open source technologies.</p>
<p>The day started with us reaching PESIT and getting a spot to set up our stall. The RALs (Regional Ambassador Lead) Abhiram, Akshay and Karthic joined us there. We were soon ready to get started. The event started off with Kaustav speaking to the participants about Firefox Developer Edition and Abhiram on the FSA program.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/21269288604_f2834a17c5_b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/uploads/img_20151002_115541-2-271x300.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The response was amazing. We had around 70 students signing up as FSA right after the introductory talk. We had to fire up additional computers to handle the crowd. We also a board titled ‘Who’s there @ inGenius 2015’ where the attendees could paste their Twitter/ Facebook handles on sticky notes. Everyone seemed to like this idea.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/12132484_10207772565898067_6227285729087459517_o.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>From time to time, various hackers approached us to know more about Mozilla and the FSA program. It was really good to see so many interested people. We later went around and talked to many teams regarding their projects and helping them with their queries and small issues. Some of the teams had really innovative ideas.By the end of the day, I had been able to mentor 5 team on various aspects of their Android apps.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/12140208_10207773373598259_5793051195472324314_o.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It was a really good experience getting to know fellow Mozillans and being able to interact with so many passionate hackers and being able to help them out. I got to know about the opportunities that lie ahead and how the program helps you grow at a personal level too. It was a true pleasure being a part of inGenius 2015.</p>
<p>Until next time…</p>
