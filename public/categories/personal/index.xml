      <description>Hey there :) I am an Android Developer currently working at KeepTruckin. Prior to this, I lead the team building the Tickertape Android app. I am also an Open Source enthusiast and an active contributor. One of the biggest projects I worked on is Firefox Focus. For more details on my career, you can take a look at my resume.
I used to conduct research on recognizing handwritten Kannada documents. You can find one of the papers on IEEEXplore.</description>

      <description>A stranger needn&amp;rsquo;t be someone you&amp;rsquo;ve never met.
It can be someone you know really well.
It can be someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t mind being in pjs in front of you.
It can be someone who planned a trip to Spain with you.
It can be someone who wanted to explore all the food streets with you.
Mom was right. Sometimes.
We should be careful of strangers.
Coz some promises are never kept.</description>

      <title>2016: a year in review</title>

      <description>I have never really done a year in review before. The reason being that I never had a year that I thought was worth a review. But this year was quite different. The first year I am truly proud of.
Favouritest thing of the year (Yes, that was an intentional typo :P)
The best about the year was my GitHub contributions graph. I went from 0 contributions in 2015 to 609 in 2016.</description>

      <description>Whenever possible, I try my best to share my learning by speaking at conferences. I have been very fortunate to be able to speak at multiple international conferences and meetups.
